# Stitching Photo Mosaics

Image warping can be used for many different applications. In this assignment image warping will be used with homographies to warp different images into the same projective view and merge them together to create an image mosaic or panorama. In the first part of this assignment the corresponding points used to compute the homography had to be manually chosen. Using the algorithms and procedures in the paper “Multi-Image Matching using Multi-Scale Oriented Patches” by Brown et al." these points can be automatically found and used to solve for the best homography between two images.
